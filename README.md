Reproducible research PA1

PART I:  Use data containing NA
1. Load the data (i.e. 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍.𝚌𝚜𝚟())
2. Process/transform the data into a format suitable for analysis
3. Calculate the mean total number of steps taken per day?
   For this part of the assignment, ignore the missing values in the dataset.

4. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

5. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
6. Determine the average daily activity pattern using a time series plot
  5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
7. Determine Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

Part II: Imputing missing values

There are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as 𝙽𝙰). 
The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

1.  Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
2.  Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. 
3.  Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
4.  Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken     per day. Determine if these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

5.  Determine if there are differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
